# DownloadCleanup
All the files that we download from the internet just get dumped in the downloads folder of our system, making it a big clutter. I have come up with a script that declutters the jumbled folder, are an OCD organizer's dream and ticks all the boxes of arranging items efficiently.

Here's how it works.
It tracks all the files and folders and moves them into a destination according to the type of extension and the last modification date if it's a file and just the last modification date if it's a folder. Thus leaving it clean and arranged well in order. Moreover, accessing files becomes just so easy because of the arrangement based on year and month.

Not only did I unjumbled the downloads folder of my system but also organized the desktop. All you need to do is to tweak the script with the source path of your folder and the destination path and, you are good to go.
